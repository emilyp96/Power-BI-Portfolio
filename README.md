I used the freely available data in the Microsoft Northwinds Database to develop a Power BI report for a project. My aim was to transform the data into a digestible format that would allow for better business decisions and improved operations.

Key Questions Answered:

Which customers contribute the most to revenue?
What are the top-selling products by category?
How do monthly sales trends behave across regions?
Which employees drive the highest sales performance?
